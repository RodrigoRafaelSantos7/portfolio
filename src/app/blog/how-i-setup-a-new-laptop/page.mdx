# How I Set Up A New Laptop

Well itâ€™s that time again, formatting for one reason or another listlessly
between computers as priorities change. Hereâ€™s a middle-depth breakdown of how I
speed-run getting a new machine off the ground.

## TL;DR

It's like 85% Homebrew automation and about 5% dotfiles and about 3% curling
tools that aren't on Homebrew and 1% making sure Mac settings are correct. What
you do with that remaining 6% is up to you, I've granted it to you as a gift â€”
do not forget this kindness.

## Preheat the oven with Homebrew

Right off the bat I'll kick open a Terminal window and install Homebrew, which
is a package manager for OSX. This tool will handle almost all of my installs
going forward â€” I'm personally quite allergic to the dance of downloading,
installing, and subsequently deleting ten thousand .pkg files from all corners
of the 'Net, and besides, this is âœ¨ automated âœ¨.

The install steps that Homebrew asks for change over time, so your best bet is
to [visit the Homebrew website and follow their directions](https://brew.sh/),
but at the time of writing, the standard way of installing is a shell command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Dotfiles Mise en Place

You've probably encountered dotfiles before, the janky extensionless files at
your home directory that you sometimes have to edit to get certain shell
commands to work, etc. Because they have so much potential for configuration,
it&apos;s super useful to store them online and reuse them, and that'll power
much of our setup. [Plenty of folks](https://dotfiles.github.io/tutorials/) have
written at length about this pattern, so I won't dive too deep here. Basically,
we're gonna create a GitHub repo at our home directory, `.gitignore` everything,
and force-add only the relevant files. That repo will then be a
quickly-downloaded source of truth for our hard-fought finicky
IDE/terminal/prompt config.

I've currently got three configuration files in my dotfiles repo: a `.hyper.js`
JSON config for Hyper terminal, a `.zshrc` for making my zsh + oh-my-zsh +
[spaceship](https://spaceship-prompt.sh/) setup work well, and a Brewfile.

## Setting Up Git And Dotfiles

If I've got my dotfiles ready on GitHub, I'll need to clone them onto a new
machine. The first step for that is making sure I can even access the repo to
clone it. Since I use GitHub to store my git projects, I follow their directions
for:

- [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent),
  and
- [Adding that new SSH key to my GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

(Obviously you could just copy and paste from the browser but I use GitHub daily
anyhow, may as well do this step now and never worry about it again!)

Once that's sorted, I can put dotfiles where they belong. Since the home
directory already has stuff in it, it won't be possible to just `git clone`, so
what we can do instead is:

```shell
cd ~
git init
git remote add origin DOTFILES_REPO_URL
git reset origin/main # we have to do this in case any of the files in dotfiles already exist
git checkout origin main
```

Now our Brewfiles/`.zshrc`/etc should have made it to where they belong! Next we
can install all the apps that will adopt these configurations.

## Installing apps with Brewfiles

One of the cooler features of Homebrew is its ability to consume package files
called Brewfiles _(similar to Gemfiles, if you're into the Ruby ecosystem at
all)_, which can perform any number of sequenced actions. I've got most of my
day-to-day apps and CLI tools sorted in the Brewfile I just pulled in the last
step, and I can install them all at once. I've included a snippet of that
Brewfile here, and you can
[view the whole thing over here](https://github.com/RodrigoRafaelSantos7/dotfiles).

```rb
# Mac Apps with `--cask`
cask "cursor"
cask "raycast"

# CLI tools with `brew install`
brew "node"

# Even font files are fair game
tap "homebrew/cask-fonts" # point Homebrew to where the font file lives
cask "font-inconsolata-nerd-font" # install it
```

Once I've got my shopping list of apps set up, I can install all of them at once
with a quick Homebrew command:

```shell
brew bundle install
```

Homebrew automatically looks to install from `~/Brewfile` if no other location
is specified, so that Dotfiles import works seamlessly. Homebrew also has really
straightforward logging â€” it'll clearly indicate what it's doing, and which of
its actions were successful or not.

## Installing apps without Brewfiles

I use two tools that don't live well with Homebrew installation: `nvm` and
`oh-my-zsh`.

NVM is a version manager for Node, and they explicitly say
[on the repo install guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/811c039e2b6fb305e6eb2269d7aa0d21eb067586/README.md?plain=1#L225)
that Homebrew install isn't supported. Theirs isâ€”at the time of writingâ€”just a
`curl` command to run their install script:

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

> Remember what I said about running random commands you find online? Doesn't it
> seem like Apple should've made a secure, native package manager so installing
> stuff doesn't feel so back alley?

Oh My Zsh is a config manager for zsh â€” it enables plugins like the _extremely_
useful
[`git` shortcuts and aliases](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git)
plugin. It's also a `curl` command:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

And that ought to do it for installs for my default setup.

## Last Steps

Believe it or not, that should be everything sorted. Homebrew does _so_ much of
the heavy lifting, usually all that remains is to do some logins (easily done if
one uses apple password manager ðŸ‘€) and configure final Mac settings. I
personally Mac settings. I personally set auto-keyboard intervention to off as a
default (I canâ€™t with the auto-capitalization and spellcheck), as well as turn
on the battery percentage in the top bar and, move the dock to the right side of
the screen.

Thanks for reading! Hope it was useful, and I hope you find some meaningful,
fitting way to get revenge on me for the time wasted if not. If you're following
this like it's a tutorial and run into any issues, please
